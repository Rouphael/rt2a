# Research Track Assignment - Ali RabbaniDoost - S5650240

This repository contains the assignments completed for the Research Track 2 course. The assignments are divided into three parts:

## Software Documentation

In the `rt1a2` folder, you can find the software documentation created using Sphinx. This documentation covers the code developed for the second assignment in the Research Track 1 course. It gives thorough explanations of the modules, functions, and code structure. The documentation was created using Sphinx, a popular documentation tool for Python projects.

## Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter Notebook, named `Rt2a2.ipynb`, is part of the second assignment. The notebook implements a graphical interface using Jupyter widgets. It allows users to interact with the program and control the motion of a robot within an environment. The notebook includes buttons for controlling the robot, a plot that visualizes the robot's position and target positions, a text box displaying the distance to the nearest obstacle, and a separate plot showing the count of reached and not-reached targets. This interactive interface enhances the user experience and provides a convenient way to monitor and control the robot's actions.

## Statistical Analysis

The third assignment involves conducting a statistical analysis to compare the performance of two algorithms. The analysis compares the program developed by myself and the program developed by my colleague as part of the first assignment in the Research Track 1 course. The complete analysis is documented in the `Statistical Analysis.pdf` file. The report provides detailed information on the analysis methodologies, findings, and conclusions, giving insights into the performance of the algorithms and their implications.

Please refer to the respective folders and files for more detailed information on each assignment.
